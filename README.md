# autodraft
Automatically draft replies in Gmail using OpenAI GPT

## How to use

1. Open [http://script.google.com ](https://script.google.com/) and create a new script
2. Set up triggers to have it call the main function (draftWithGpt) once an hour or daily if you prefer
3. You'll see your emails labeled with a new label called 'autodrafted' after it's been processed. Remove the label if you want it to be re-drafted again.
